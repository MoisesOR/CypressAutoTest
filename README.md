## Steps

* Cypress Open: `npx cypress open`
* Cypress Run: `npx cypress run`
* Common options:
  1. `--project "project_name"`
  2. `--key "cypress.io_key"`


## Common Errors

* Solution: ["TypeError: Cannot read property 'passes' of undefined"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55138378/got-typeerror-cannot-read-property-passes-of-undefined-using-cypress-when-gen)
Install version 5.2.0 from mocha `npm install mocha@5.2.0.`

* Cypress failed to start. This is usually caused by a missing library or dependency. The error below should indicate which dependency is missing... When `npx cypress open`.
Reinstall cypres with `npx cypress install --force`.

## Last implementation (09-01-2020)
* [Cypress-log-to-output](https://github.com/flotwig/cypress-log-to-output): Now we can see logs in our command and check if some log is showed. This code is on `plugins >> index.js`
